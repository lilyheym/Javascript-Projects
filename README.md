### Pizza Menu

A menu is used to order a pizza with a various selection of toppings. Then, the input information is used to calculate a price for that order.

### Tic-Tac_Toe Game

I mean, it's tic-tac-toe: what more is there to say? Plays like tha classic game, users place down tokens in an attempt to beat the program and the winner is celebrated with a winning tone.

### Calculator

A basic four function calculator. It can be used to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Unfortunately you cannot use it to play Tetris.
